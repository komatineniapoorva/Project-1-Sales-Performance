This project involves extracting and cleaning sales data using SQL queries, importing it into Power BI, and creating dynamic visualizations. Line charts depict sales trends over time, bar charts showcase product performance, and KPI cards offer summarized metrics. The addition of filters allows users to analyze data based on specific time periods, regions, and product categories. The outcome is an interactive Power BI dashboard with a visually-rich tool for ongoing performance monitoring and strategic decision-making
